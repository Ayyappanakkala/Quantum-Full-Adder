## Background

Quantum computing leverages quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates to perform complex computations. However, quantum computers are susceptible to errors due to environmental factors, making quantum fault tolerance crucial for practical quantum computation.

## Full Adder Circuit

A full adder is a digital circuit that takes in three binary inputs (A, B, and Carry-In) and produces two binary outputs, Sum and Carry-Out. The truth table for a full adder is as follows:

| A   | B   | Carry-In | Sum | Carry-Out |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- | --------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0        | 0   | 0         |
| 0   | 1   | 0        | 1   | 0         |
| 1   | 0   | 0        | 1   | 0         |
| 1   | 1   | 0        | 0   | 1         |
| 0   | 0   | 1        | 1   | 0         |
| 0   | 1   | 1        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 0   | 1        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 1   | 1        | 1   | 1         |

## Quantum Fault Tolerance

Quantum fault tolerance is the ability of a quantum circuit to perform reliable quantum computation despite errors that may occur during the quantum operations. Quantum error correction codes, such as the surface code, are employed to detect and correct errors.

The full adder circuit can be implemented in a quantum fault-tolerant manner using error-correcting codes, which involve the use of logical qubits that span multiple physical qubits. These codes allow for error detection and correction, enhancing the reliability of quantum computations.

## Implementation

The implementation of a quantum fault-tolerant full adder circuit typically involves encoding the input qubits into a suitable error-correcting code and applying quantum gates to perform the addition operation. Error correction steps are included to mitigate errors that may occur during the computation.

This circuit may involve logical qubits, syndrome measurements, and error correction procedures, which can be complex.
